## Overview

The MCP tab manages Model Context Protocol servers with status detection and configuration viewing.

## Features

- **Server list** showing all configured MCP servers
- **Status detection**: checks if servers are running/responding
- **Configuration viewing** for each server's settings
- **Tool listing** showing available tools per server

## What is MCP?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers extend Claude Code's capabilities with external tools (databases, APIs, file systems, etc.). ccboard reads MCP configuration from your Claude Code setup and displays server status.

## Unique to ccboard

ccboard is the only Claude Code dashboard that provides MCP server status detection. Other tools (ccusage, agtrace) don't monitor MCP status.
