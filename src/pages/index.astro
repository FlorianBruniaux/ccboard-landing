It provides 9 interactive tabs for monitoring sessions, analyzing costs, managing config, hooks, agents, and MCP servers. Built in Rust with a 5.8MB binary." } },
    { "@type": "Question", name: "How does the cache work?", acceptedAnswer: { "@type": "Answer", text: "ccboard uses SQLite to cache session metadata with mtime-based invalidation. This provides an 89x speedup (20s → 224ms) after the first run, with >99% cache hit rate." } },
    { "@type": "Question", name: "Does it work on Linux/Windows?", acceptedAnswer: { "@type": "Answer", text: "Yes! ccboard supports macOS (fully tested), Linux (community-tested), and Windows (experimental)." } },
    { "@type": "Question", name: "How much does it cost?", acceptedAnswer: { "@type": "Answer", text: "ccboard is free and open-source, licensed under MIT OR Apache-2.0. No subscription, no hidden costs." } },
    { "@type": "Question", name: "Can I use the web interface?", acceptedAnswer: { "@type": "Answer", text: "Yes! Run ccboard web --port 3333 for the web UI, or ccboard both to run TUI + Web simultaneously. The web interface has 100% feature parity with the TUI." } },
    { "@type": "Question", name: "Does it support real-time monitoring?", acceptedAnswer: { "@type": "Answer", text: "Yes! ccboard includes a file watcher that monitors ~/.claude changes with 500ms debounce. Live updates appear in both TUI and Web via Server-Sent Events." } },
    { "@type": "Question", name: "What's the difference with ccusage/agtrace?", acceptedAnswer: { "@type": "Answer", text: "ccusage (10K stars) is a CLI cost tracker (no dashboard). agtrace focuses on observability. ccboard is the only multi-concern dashboard combining config, hooks, agents, MCP status, and advanced analytics in a single TUI+Web binary." } },
    { "@type": "Question", name: "How do I contribute?", acceptedAnswer: { "@type": "Answer", text: "Contributions welcome! See CONTRIBUTING.md for guidelines. Fork the repo, create a feature branch, run tests (cargo test --all), and open a Pull Request." } },
